Description:
    There are 4 types of sorting algorithms included: Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quicksort, 
    and one that was created with the help of ChatGPT and based on TimSort (AdhikariMedhashreeSort).

    Insertion sort:
        Insertion sort takes an array of elements and essentially swaps value as it makes its way down the array and
        sorts in the given order.

    Merge sort:
        Merge sort takes an array of elements, adjusts the lower and upper bounds recursively (breaks it down to one element),
        then (still recursively) compares and sorts the values.

    Quicksort:
        Quicksort takes an array of elements, picks one value (pivot) in the array, compares the other elements to that value, and
        sorts it around that. Essentially, the values being compared to the pivot will be on the left or right side of it.

    AdhikariMedhashreeSort:
        This sorting algorithim is a combination of merge sort and insertion sort.
